<li>Breath-taking Landscape/Biodiversity</li>
<p>While you travel through Bhutan you will find steep and high mountains crisscrossing by networks of swift rivers. The extra-ordinary geographical diversity and the diverse climate conditions play an important in contributing to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems, which would leave you stunned.</p>
<br>
<li>Varying and Flexible Weather</li>
<p>Bhutan experiences five prominent seasons namely summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. The western part of Bhutan experiences heavier monsoon rains whereas the southern part undergoes hot humid summers and cool winters and the central and eastern Bhutan remain temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters. Bhutan hence gives the flexibility for you to choose the location and the time of the year to visit, depending upon the preferable climatic conditions.</p>
<br>
<li>Gross National Happiness</li>
<p>Gross National Happiness is Bhutan’s development philosophy based on Buddhist values that measures the quality of life based on the spiritual and mental well-being of its people. It does not reject the conventional method of measuring development – GDP but GNH is pursued as an alternative development philosophy.</p>
<br>
<li>Highest Unclimbed Mountains</li>
<p>If you are one of those mountain trek loving or people or hikers, Bhutan would not disappoint you and in fact would contribute significantly to your adrenaline rush and trek excitement. Bhutan has some of the highest unclimbed mountains in the world – <mark>Mount Jhomolhari</mark>, <mark>Jitchu Drake</mark>, etc.</p>
<br>
<li>Thirteen unique arts and crafts of Bhutan</li>
<p>The 13 Bhutanese Arts and Crafts known as the <i><mark>Zorig Chusum</mark></i> is symbolic and rooted in Buddhist philosophy. They are; woodwork, stonework, carving, painting, sculpting, wood turning, black smithy, ornament making, bamboo work, paper making, tailoring and weaving. Pema Lingpa, a treasure discoverer, introduced these arts and crafts to Bhutan in the 15th century.</p>
<br>
<li>Mesmerising Tiger Monestary</li>
<p><mark><i>Taktsang Palphug</i></mark> or Tiger’s Nest Monastery as it is more well-known, clings to a cliffside that is set above the rice paddy fields of Paro. It will take you between two to three-hours to trek there, but once you arrive you will be treated to a refreshing cup of tea and some of the most impressive views of the country.</p>
<br>
<li>Traditional Hot Stone Baths</li>
<p>Bhutan is home to possibly the world’s best spa therapy – traditional hot stone baths. They heat large stones over a fire and then use them to warm your bathwater. Stepping into one of these steaming tubs of mineralised goodness, particularly in the colder months, is a phenomenal feeling.</p>
