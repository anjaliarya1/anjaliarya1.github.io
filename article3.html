<p>Well, in today’s world who doesn’t like to travel or explore new places? I think most of us do for our own reasons. But, travelling often requires ample time, planning and also resources to meet your expenditure. School, college students generally find it very difficult to travel some good places without incurring huge expenditure. In order to address that issue, we have prepared a list of amazing places that not only are stunning but also, they will not leave a hole in your pockets.</p>
<ol>
